#### ----------Investment app------------
It is an app built with streamlit and published with heroku where an application was created that maximizes the return for a given level of risk (CVaR - conditional value at risk) using linear programming. The application also contains a backtest, where it is possible to go back in time and evaluate the performance of a portfolio optimized to minimize the risk.

#### ----------LLM With RAG------------
This project aims to create a Language Model (LLM) that interacts with users about their favorite books. Users can select their preferred books and then ask questions or engage in conversations about those books with the LLM.

#### ------------------App Recommender-----------------
App recommendation engine. Uses the app database per user (collaborative filtering) + user or apps features to make a recommendation. By default, the training model is the LightFM, a hybrid latent representation recommender model. The loss function used is WARP - Weighted Approximate-Rank Pairwise

#### -------------------Fraud Detection-----------
It is a complete end-to-end project, where I did the exploratory analysis, modeling, evaluation and deployment of a fraud detection system.

[<img alt="Credit Fraud" src="https://github.com/Brunoborges95/Brunoborges95/assets/36872369/59261a67-a3c8-481c-9215-ab859ff4f66e"  width="300" height="200">](https://github.com/Brunoborges95/E2E_DS_Fraud_Detection)

#### --------Forecast with SARIMAX-----------
A time series project, where Walmart's M5 competition database was used as a dataset and the MAPA - Multiple Aggregation Prediction Algorithm technique. Temporal aggregation can help identify the characteristics of series as they are refined through different frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly, bimonthly, for example). The aim is to show that using multiple levels of temporal aggregation can lead to substantial improvements in terms of performance prediction.

#### -----------------AWS Data Lake---------------
In this series of articles on Medium, I talk about how to create a datalake on AWS using Kinesis, Lake Formation, Glue, and datalakehouse frameworks (Hudi, Iceberg, and Delta Lake).
In the first article, I discuss how to use Kinesis to send real-time data to an S3 bucket.
In the second article, I introduce Lake Formation and the steps to create one.
In the third article, I present the concept of a data lakehouse and how you can implement any of the three open-source frameworks using Glue.
The idea is to continue writing posts, not only covering data engineering aspects but also discussing modeling and deployment on Sagemaker. Enjoy reading!

#### ---------------Recommender with Pyspark-------
It's a project that deals with one of the areas I like most: Recommender systems! Here I implemented a system that uses collaborative filtering to recommend video games to users. The ALS algorithm was used with the pyspark ecosystem

#### ----------Autoencoders--------------
Autoencorder is a type of neural network architecture that aroused my interest. I tried to compile in this article some interesting applications that I read in academic articles and other posts, such as recommendation systems, synthetic data generation and anomaly detection, with code implementation using tensorflow and some famous datasets.

#### -----------------My arcticles on Linkedin---------------
I wrote some articles on LinkedIn (in Portuguese):
- For those interested in investments, data science and optimization algorithms, I wrote an article on how to optimize the risk-return relationship of investment portfolios using data science techniques for linear and non-linear optimization and using genetic algorithms.

- How to find the cluster number - In this text we will use some clustering techniques (K-Means, Affinity Propagation and hierarchical algorithms) to segment customers on a credit basis and we will study different techniques to find the ideal number of clusters.

  [<img alt="Clusters" src="https://github.com/Brunoborges95/Data-Science-Projects/assets/36872369/e2e6bfb0-73f1-4dd0-979a-c90497ff8e0a"  width="300" height="200">](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/algoritmos-de-clusteriza%25C3%25A7%25C3%25A3o-m%25C3%25A9todos-para-definir-o-borges-de-souza/?trackingId=ZCt7jt8FRN6S6m05zLnVlw%3D%3D)

- Credit Fraud Detection - Here we will discuss methods for applying machine learning to unbalanced bases, taking as an example a fraud detection problem. Comparison will be made with Random Forest, XGBoost and semi-supervised learning algorithms using Gaussian mixture and autoencoders.

- Philosophy! In this article we will see what a "good model" means in science and how hypothesis testing validates scientific knowledge. The "source of knowledge" will also be discussed, with its empiricist and rationalist schools of thought and some discussions about machine learning algorithm models.

#### -----------------Credit Approval Model--------
The objective of this challenge is to build a classification model that returns the probability that a customer has of being sent for credit analysis given that they have been pre-approved for a car loan. This way, the company can prioritize customers who are most likely to be served first.
